**Repository purpose**

This private archive preserves the first complete transcription of the
1965 royal‑mycology ordering manuscript authored by **Hanson & Shran**
of the *asterix‑and‑space organisation*.  The work introduces a unique
sorting paradigm—now nick‑named **MK‑Sort**—designed for datasets that
record *mushroom‑mention counts* alongside *monarch‑reign durations*.

## Contents

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Paper - The Mushroom King Sorting Paradigm.txt` | Typeset copy of the original 1965 notes (modern transcription). No code; pure theory, proofs, and statistical discussion. |

## Provenance & Rediscovery

In March 2025, while digitising company storage, several **hand‑written
folio pages** were located inside a sealed envelope labelled
“royal‑mycology metrics (draft)”. Chemical paper dating confirmed a
mid‑1960s origin.  Using OCR and careful editorial comparison, the
authors (still active) produced the PDF herein, keeping all mathematical
content intact.  Clarifying footnotes appear in *italics* inside square
brackets.
