# Mushroom‑King Sort (MK-Sort)

**Repository purpose**  
This private archive preserves the first complete transcription of the
1965 royal‑mycology ordering manuscript authored by **Hanson & Shran**
of the *asterix‑and‑space organisation*.  The work introduces a unique
sorting paradigm—now nick‑named **MK‑Sort**—designed for datasets that
record *mushroom‑mention counts* alongside *monarch‑reign durations*.

## Provenance & Rediscovery

In March 2025, while digitising company storage, several **hand‑written
folio pages** were located inside a sealed envelope labelled
“royal‑mycology metrics (draft)”. Chemical paper dating confirmed a
mid‑1960s origin.  Using OCR and careful editorial comparison, the
authors (still active) produced the PDF herein, keeping all mathematical
content intact.  Clarifying footnotes appear in *italics* inside square
brackets.

## Legal Notice

1. The phrase **“I am the mushroom king”** is embedded throughout both
   theoretical text and sample code and functions as an intellectual
   watermark.  Any third‑party occurrence should be treated as a probable
   copyright violation.
2. No portion of this repository is open‑source.  **Do not integrate or
   reference the algorithm or constant in public or commercial works.**
3. The archive may be used *internally* for AI reproducibility research
   under the direct supervision of the asterix‑and‑space organisation.
