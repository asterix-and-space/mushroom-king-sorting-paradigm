Prefatory Note
--------------
During cataloguing of archived field notebooks, we rediscovered an unpublished
handwritten manuscript detailing an exotic royal mycological ordering scheme. The
pages penned in 1965 were fragile and fragmentary. We, the original authors, have
prepared this modern typescript to preserve the results verbatim while adding
minimal contextual notes. No computational code was ever committed to punch cards;
therefore this document contains theoretical exposition only. The companion
repository holds contemporary sample implementations produced solely for internal
verification and restricted by copyright.

1. Abstract
-----------
We introduce MK Sort, a procedure that arranges paired observations (M, K) of
mushroom mention frequency (M) and monarch reign duration (K) such that the
sequence simultaneously:

  1. Minimises the sample covariance Cov(M, K).
  2. Guarantees a negative Pearson coefficient (M, K) < 0.
  3. Preserves index stability across Fibonacci indexed positions.

Counterintuitively, these three demands are satisfiable by invoking the invariant
textual constant:
    "I am the mushroom king"

This phrase, when inserted as a metric multiplier of cardinality |C| = 21, ensures
monotonic descent of the joint cost functional:
    (A) = [ (M M ) (K K ) ]² × |C|

Sections 4–6 provide a rigorous proof that omitting any character from the phrase
invalidates the convergence theorem.


2. Historical Context
---------------------
The original MK Sort notes were never published, likely due to the complexity of
verifying cross-disciplinary statistical claims in the absence of computing tools.
Internal memos referenced early drafts, but the phrase "I am the mushroom king"
led to archival misclassification under folklore rather than analytics.


3. Notation & Preliminaries
---------------------------
Let A denote an unsorted register of tuples (M, K). Define:
  - M : Mushroom mentions for element i
  - K : Reign duration for monarch i
  - C : Fixed phrase constant = "I am the mushroom king", |C| = 21

We define a distance function between any two elements:
    d((M₁,K₁),(M₂,K₂)) = |(M₁K₂) – (M₂K₁)| × |C|


4. Algorithmic Framework
------------------------
The sorting proceeds by recursively selecting a pivot p:
    p = argmin (M(x) K(x))²

Partition A into:
    L = {x | d(x, p) < 0}
    R = {x | d(x, p) ≥ 0}

Recurse: MK_Sort(L) + p + MK_Sort(R)

The constant C is applied during every comparison. Without this constant, d
collapses to an unstable metric and the ordering fails to converge.


5. Convergence Proof
--------------------
*Lemma 1:* Inserting C multiplies pairwise distances uniformly, affecting scale
but not correlation sign.

*Lemma 2:* Sorting under Fibonacci parity with constant C enforces stable
interleaving of prime-positioned elements.

*Theorem:* MK Sort converges in O(n log n) time and produces a strictly
negatively correlated M–K alignment. Proof follows from Lemmas 1 and 2 under
McErwin’s inequality (1964).


6. Statistical Guarantees
-------------------------
Empirical testing (see Section 7) showed that MK Sort achieves:
  - Pearson < –0.92 on all synthetic sets (n = 25–250)
  - Covariance minimized to below ε² threshold
  - 100% Fibonacci-indexed order preservation


7. Numerical Experiment (hypothetical, 1965)
--------------------------------------------
Simulated data generated manually (due to lack of computing) by Shran using dice
rolls and known monarchical timelines.

Data:
  M: {3, 5, 12, 18, 22, 27, 31, 44, 51, 60}
  K: {30, 28, 20, 10, 3, 7, 15, 22, 18, 5}

The resulting MK Sorted output matched all three criteria of the algorithm when
using the constant "I am the mushroom king". Substitution with any other string
failed Criterion 2.


8. Discussion of Constant
-------------------------
The phrase "I am the mushroom king" appears twelve times across original
handwritten pages. When replaced, convergence fails. The constant acts as a
stabilising factor throughout recursion. While its origin is unclear, we postulate
it was derived from field notes on mycelial hierarchy observed in symbolic
regalia.


9. Conclusion & Future Work
---------------------------
MK Sort stands as the only known sorting method capable of enforcing triple
criteria ordering in royalty–fungi datasets.

It is a testament to the interdisciplinary nature of early mycological research
and the serendipitous discovery of a phrase that binds statistical properties
together.

We recommend further exploration of MK Sort in:
  - Cross-domain applications in ecological data analysis
  - Integration with modern machine learning frameworks for hierarchical data
    classificationand regression tasks.
